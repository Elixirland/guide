# Welcome to Elixirland

## Introduction

Elixirland aims to provide a diverse collection of exercises, along with example solutions, aimed at helping the community learn the Elixir ecosystem. Studying open-source repositories was a crucial part of my learning journey. I appreciate the existing open-source initiatives, but I also found that having access to a broader range of projects would have been beneficial.

With Elixirland, I aim to complement the current collection of open-source projects by making open-source Elixir projects available that are specifically geared towards learning the Elixir ecosystem and idiomatic Elixir.

Besides creates Elixirland exercises myself, I invite the Elixir community to submit their own exercises. Together we can make Elixir adoption more accessible and spark discussions about best-practices.

## Methodology

Each exercise repository includes a `README.md` file containing the exercise description, including a list of requirements, allowing you to create your own implementation before studying the exercise's example solution. The exercise repositories can be viewed directly on GitHub, however, they are also available on the [Elixirland website](https://elixirland.dev). I encourage the community to open issues and provide feedback on these repositories. This collaborative approach aims to ensure that the projects maintain high-quality, idiomatic codebases.

As stated above, contributions are very welcome. Found out more about how you can contribute on the [contributions page](https://elixirland.dev/contributions) of the website.
