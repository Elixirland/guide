# Welcome to Elixirland

## Introduction

Elixirland wants to make it easier and more fun to learn the Elixir ecosystem by providing projects your can build and example implementations that you can learn from. Studying open-source repositories was a crucial part of my learning journey. I appreciate the existing open-source initiatives, but I also found that having access to a broader range of projects would have been beneficial.

With Elixirland, I aim to complement the current collection of open-source projects by making open-source Elixir projects available that are specifically geared towards learning the Elixir ecosystem and idiomatic Elixir.

Besides creates Elixirland projects myself, I invite the Elixir community to submit their own projects. Together we can make Elixir adoption more accessible and spark discussions about best-practices.

## Methodology

Each project repository includes a `README.md` file containing the project description, including a list of requirements, allowing you to create your own implementation before studying the project's example implementation. The project repositories can be viewed directly on GitHub, however, they are also available on the [Elixirland website](https://elixirland.dev). I encourage the community to open issues and provide feedback on these repositories. This collaborative approach aims to ensure that the projects maintain high-quality, idiomatic codebases.
