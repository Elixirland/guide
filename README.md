# Welcome to Elixirland

## Introduction

Elixirland is a project dedicated to providing a diverse collection of open-source Elixir projects aimed at helping the community learn and master the Elixir ecosystem. While I appreciate the existing open-source initiatives, I found that having access to a broader range of projects would have been beneficial during my learning journey.

With Elixirland, I aim to complement the current collection of open-source projects by creating smaller, focused projects that emphasize learning the Elixir ecosystem. These projects aim to adhere to idiomatic Elixir practices.

## Methodology

Each repository within Elixirland will include a README file containing an assignment in the form of a list of requirements, allowing you to create your own implementation before studying the repository's codebase. Additionally, each repository will have a status indicator, clearly stating whether the codebase has been reviewed by others in the community. I encourage the community to open issues and provide feedback on these repositories. This collaborative approach aims to ensure that the projects maintain high-quality, idiomatic codebases.

**Note**: The primary focus of these repositories is to serve as learning resources. Therefore, the projects may not necessarily have real-world applications.

## Contributions
As stated above, contributions are welcome. Whether in the form of code reviewing, opening an issue or creating pull requests.
